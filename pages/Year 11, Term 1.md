- ### Water (A1.1)
	- **How is water the medium for life?**#card
		- Water acts like a vital solvent due to its polar structure and also serves as a medium for metabolic and chemical reactions and also for transport (e.g., blood) .
	- **Describe Earth's environment after it was created**.#card
		- It had little to no oxygen in its atmosphere and no water on its surface due to the extremely high temperature.
	- **How did hydrothermal vents serve as environments for the first life forms to form?**#card

	- **Explain the structure of the water molecule**.#card
		- A water molecule is two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to one oxygen atom, ( *with a bent shape due to oxygen's lone electron pairs* ). Oxygen is more electronegative, thus there is an uneven sharing of electrons. In biology, covalent bonds are extremely strong.
	- **What bonds form between water molecules**?#card
		- Hydrogen bonding (dipole - dipole bonding)
	- **What is hydrolysis?**#card
		- Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction where a molecule is broken down by the addition of a water molecule.
	- **How is water a solvent?**#card
		- It is polar, which allows it to break apart many other polar molecules through the formation of hydrogen bonds
	- **What substances that can dissolve into blood plasma?**#card
		- Glucose, amino acids, sodium chloride (polar)  *oxygen has limited solubility *
	- **What substances that cannot dissolve into blood plasma?**#card

	- **What are cell walls made of and are they hydrophobic or hydrophilic?**#card
		- Cellulose, hydrophilic
	- **What is xylem?**#card
		- Xylem are thin, narrow vessels/tubes that transport water (and dissolved minerals) from the roots to the leaves of plants.
	- **What is capillary action?**#card
		- Capillary action describes the ability to flow against gravity in a narrow space or through certain membranes.
	- **How can water travel from the roots and up the xylem?**#card
		- This occurs through capillary action. The cohesive nature of polar water molecules allows water to form a continuous column (without breaking) of water molecules moving up the xylem/stem of plants and adhesion allows some of them to also stick to plant walls made of polar cellulose. **This is known as a transpiration stream**
	- **What is transpiration?**#card
		- Transpiration is the evaporation of water from the leaves of plants.
	- **How can water move through soil**?#card
		- Soil tends to be porous and has polar molecules which adheres to water (and vice versa) allowing it to experience capillary action.
	- **Describe capillary action in the cell wall.**#card
		- The apoplast pathway allows water and dissolved nutrients to move through cell walls of plants (made of cellulose which is polar and porous) through capillary action.
	- **What is the difference between apoplastic pathway and symplastic pathway?**#card
		- Apoplastic pathway is through membrane to membrane while the symplastic pathway is between cytoplasm to cytoplasm (substances have to actually enter the cell).
	- **What is surface tension?**#card
		- Surface tension is the energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid and depends on the cohesive forces of the liquid. The stronger the cohesive forces, the stronger the surface tension. Water's surface can act like a thin, elastic membrane due to this force as water on the surface can only form hydrogen bonds with internal molecules.
	- **How is surface tension useful for insects like water striders?**#card
		- It allows them to move very fast on water and also allows water to serve as its habitat.
	- **What is viscosity?**#card
		- Viscosity is the ability of a liquid to resist flow. Water has lower viscosity due to weaker intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonding) than, for example, honey but is more viscous than air due to stronger hydrogen bonding.
	- **What are factors that determine viscosity?** #card
		- The strength of intermolecular forces (the greater the strength, the higher of viscosity)
		- The size and shape of the molecule (greater the size of molecule, the more restricted the movement of the molecule is thus higher viscosity)
		- The temperature (the greater the temperature, the higher the kinetic energy and thus lower viscosity)
	- **What are cohesive forces?**#card
		- Cohesive forces are the attractive forces between water molecules.
	- **Why does water in a droplet turn into a sphere on hydrophobic surfaces?**#card
		- It does this to minimise surface area and contact with the surface.

	- **What are adhesive forces?**#card
		- Adhesive forces are the attractive forces between water and polar molecules.
	- **Why does water tend to form one big droplet when two droplets are placed next to each other?**#card
		- Water droplets experience cohesive forces which make them attracted to each other, forming one bigger droplet.
	- **Why is a concave meniscus formed with water in a glass container?**#card
		- It is because water's strong adhesion to the glass is greater than its cohesion to itself.

		- Buoyancy is the upward force exerted on an object submerged in a fluid. This is because hydrogen bonding makes water denser.
	- **What is thermal conductivity?**#card
		- The measure of a material's ability to conduct heat. Water has high thermal conductivity.
	- **What is specific heat capacity?**#card
		- The energy required to raise the temperature of 1 g of a substance by 1 K. The temperature of large bodies of water is much more stable than air temperature as water can absorb or release much more heat energy. This is caused by hydrogen bonding.
	- **What aquatic adaptations does the black-throated loon have?** #card
		- They have solid bones that are less dense than most terrestrial organisms, allowing it to dive but also retain buoyancy.
		- Their legs are on their rear, making it hard to walk on land but very effective in propulsion in water (more viscous than air on land).
		- Their feathers serve as a barrier to water to prevent heat loss (high thermal conductivity of water).
	- **What aquatic adaptations does the ringed seal have?** #card
		- It has denser bones than the loon to stay submerged for long periods of time (less buoyancy).
		- The seals have streamlined bodies to move effectively through water (higher viscosity than air).
		- The ringed seal has an outer coat of fur and blubber to prevent heat loss (high thermal conductivity of water).
		- They do not have cooling mechanisms (due to high specific heat capacity of water, thus do not need it).
	- **Describe water as a metabolic medium.** #card
		- Solutes dissolved into aqueous solutions are more likely to collide with enzymes and undergo necessary chemical reactions
		- Water can also promote enzyme activity by absorbing heat from exothermic reactions and maintain acid-base neutrality
		- Polar substances can dissociate in water
	- **Describe water as a transport medium.** #card

	- **What is denaturation?**#card
		- Denaturation is a conformational change in the shape of a molecule, such as a protein, resulting in the loss of a function. In simple words, this is unfolding. This can occur through extreme changes in pH and temperature. Proteins have an optimum temperature and pH and changes in this can denature the protein (this temperature is usually 37 degrees on average but can change depending on the part of the body).
	- **Why is denaturation not good for the protein?**#card

		- Sites where non-competitive inhibitors bind.
	- **What can enzymes do to reactions?**#card
		- They can increase their speed by lowering activation energy.
	- **What is the connection between collision theory and enzymes?**#card
		- Enzymes and substrates need to collide with sufficient energy and correct orientation, according to collision theory. In the absence of an enzyme, the activation energy of the reaction would be  greater and thus less molecules would react. Active sites on enzymes are specific to the substrate, according to the induced fit model, thus substrates need to collide with the enzyme at the active sites with the correct orientation and with sufficient energy. Hydrogen bonds hold the substrate in the active site, ensuring for correct orientation. Enzymes are not used in the chemical reaction.
	- **How can reaction rate be increased with enzymes (make reference to collision theory)?** #card
		- Increasing temperature (more kinetic energy, increased frequency of collisions)
		- Increasing substrate concentration (increased probability of substrate colliding with an active site, increase frequency of collisions)
		- Immobilisation of substrates (large substrates, such as proteins and starch,  can be immobilized to allow for repeated enzymatic hydrolysis of a macromolecule into monomers)
		- Immobilisation of enzymes in membranes (immobilizing an enzyme keeps it in close proximity to the substrates that it catalyses. The membrane also helps to maintain the stability of the enzyme)

	- **What are lipids?**#card
		- Lipids are hydrophobic, non-polar molecules (insoluble in water) that include fats, oils, waxes, and steroids. They are made of a glycerol backbone, fatty acid and phosphate group. The monomer of lipids are 'fatty acids', consisting of a chain of carbon atoms.
	- **What is the difference between a lipid and a fat?**#card
