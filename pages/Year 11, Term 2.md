- ### **Water potential (D3.3)**
  collapsed:: true
	- **Describe osmosis.**#card
		- Osmosis is movement of water from a low solute concentration to a high solute concentration.
	- **What is osmolarity?**#card
		- Measurement of solute concentration of a solution
	- **What is hypotonic?**#card
		- Lower solute concentration, high water potential
	- **What is isotonic?**#card
		- Same solute concentration
	- **What is hypertonic?**#card
		- Higher solute concentration, low water potential
	- **What does it mean to be in equilibrium across a membrane?**#card
		- Water molecules continue moving but there is no net movement due to having the same solute concentrations on either side.
	- **Why do IV's used to rehydrate people have saline (salt) in them?**#card
		- If it is too hypotonic (when it hypothetically has pure water), it can cause the cells to burst as person is rehydrated too fast. IV's usually have isotonic solutions (Ringer's solution) relative to the person's blood plasma to prevent shrivelling or bursting.
	- **What would happen when animal cells are placed in a hypertonic solution?**#card
		- It would shrivel (water leaves the cell).
	- **What would happen when animal cells are placed in a hypotonic solution?**#card
		- It would swell and undergo lysis (burst) (as the water enters the cell)
	- **What happens when plant cells are placed in a hypertonic solution?**#card
		- They become plasmolysed. The vacuole within the cell shrivels but the plant cells themselves do not die due to their cell membrane moving away from the cell wall, allowing them to be rehydrated.
	- **What happens when plant cells are placed in a hypotonic solution?**#card
		- They become turgid, which is ideal for them. The water enters the cytoplasm and then the vacuole, causing the cell membrane to be pushed against the cell wall. The cell wall is rigid, thus there is a maximum amount the cell membrane can swell, and they will not undergo lysis, which makes them strong.
	- **What is the ideal condition for plants?**#card
		- Being turgid due to being in a hypotonic solution, as the water helps them have support.
	- **What happens when plant cells are placed in an isotonic solution?**#card
		- The vacuole within the cell is neither fully filled or shrivelled. There is no net movement of water in and out of the cell. In this case, the cell wall can be
	- **What adaptations do unicellular organisms have to survive hypertonic/hypotonic solutions?**#card
		- They have contractile vacuoles to expel water to prevent bursting in hypotonic solutions.
	- **What are contractile vacuoles?**#card
		- They get filled with water and expand but then expel the water, maintaining homeostasis.

- ### B2.2 Organelles and comparmentalisation
	- What are organelles? #card
		- Compartmentalised, subcellular structures found within a cell which have specific functions. Cell walls, cytoplasms and cytoskeletons are **not** considered organelles.
	- What is cell fractionation and how did it help scientists learn about cells? #card
		- It is used to isolate different organelles to be studied by breaking apart cells. Cells must be submerged in a cold (to reduce enzyme activity to prevent damage to organelles), isotonic (to prevent shriveling or bursting of **organelles**) and buffered (to keep a constant pH) solution. There are two steps:
		- Homogenisation (breaking apart using a blender and filtration to remove large cell debris)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Ultracentrifguation (differential centrifugation where it is spun at different stages and at each stage the supernated (liquid) is removed to leave a pellet of a specific organelle, this is repeated)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Describe the process of ultracentrifugation in cell fraction. #card
		- The filtered solution is spun at a low speed by a centrifuge.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- The densest pellet is at the bottom.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- The supernated solution (at the top) is removed to leave the pellet of an organelle.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- The process is repeated with faster and faster speeds.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Describe the order of pellets formed by ultracentrifugation. #card
		- Nuclei -> chloroplast (in a plant cell) -> mitochondria -> lysosome -> endoplasmic reticulum -> ribosomes
	- What is the advantage of the separation of the nucleus and cytoplasm into separate compartments? #card
		- It allows process of transcription of mRNA to be separated from other metabolic processes within the cell. It also ensures DNA is protected from harmful reactions in the cytoplasm.
	- What is compartmentalisation? #card
		- Process of creating separation within cells. Organelles are an example of this which allow for greater efficiency and provide a protective environment for specialised activities which are not compatible with other metabolic processes.
	- What are lysosomes? #card
		- Organelles that contain enzymes to digest macromolecules and digest cell components. For example, if the cell is damaged, the enzymes are released which leads to its digestion.
- ### B2.3 Cell specialisation
	- What is SAV (surface area to volume ratio)? #card
		- Mathematical ratio between surface area to volume that can help describe the efficiency of the cell.
	- What effect does compartmentalisation have on SAV? #card
		- It increases surface area to volume ratio which increases efficiency of cell processes and increases absorption etc.
	- Though smaller cells have greater SAV, why are cells that are too small not necessarily optimal? #card
		- If the volume is too low, it cannot hold enough organelles to carry out many cell functions, which actually reduces efficiency. So both surface area and volume are important.
	- What is a stem cell? #card
		- Undifferentiated cells which have an unlimited capacity to divide and can differentiate into specalised cells. They change through differential gene expression.
	- What type of stem cells are adult stem cells? #card
		- Multipotent
	- What is a totipotent stem cell? #card
		- Stem cells that can differentiate into all types of cells or develop into an embryo.
	- What is a unipotent stem cell? #card
	- What is a pluripotent? #card
		- Cells that can differentiate into all types of cells, except
	- What are morphogens? #card
		- Group of gene regulating chemicals which determine the specialised cell that develops according to their concentration.
	- What are stem cell niches? #card
		- Locations in the body where stem cells can be maintained or promoted to proliferate and differentiate. For example, bone marrow is a niche for hematopoietic stem cells, hair follicles contain many types of stem cells, such as epithelial, mesenchymal (hair) cells that can self-renew, differentiate, regulate hair growth and maintain skin homeostasis.
	- How do stem cells divide? #card
		- They divide asymmetrically through mitosis, where one becomes another stem cell after division, but the other becomes a differentiated cell. This prolongs the life of the stem cell (as it makes a copy of itself).
