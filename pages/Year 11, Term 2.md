- ### **Water potential (D3.3)**
  collapsed:: true
	- **Describe osmosis.**#card
		- Osmosis is movement of water from a low solute concentration to a high solute concentration.
	- **What is osmolarity?**#card
		- Measurement of solute concentration of a solution
	- **What is hypotonic?**#card
		- Lower solute concentration, high water potential
	- **What is isotonic?**#card
		- Same solute concentration
	- **What is hypertonic?**#card
		- Higher solute concentration, low water potential
	- **What does it mean to be in equilibrium across a membrane?**#card
		- Water molecules continue moving but there is no net movement due to having the same solute concentrations on either side.
	- **Why do IV's used to rehydrate people have saline (salt) in them?**#card
		- If it is too hypotonic (when it hypothetically has pure water), it can cause the cells to burst as person is rehydrated too fast. IV's usually have isotonic solutions (Ringer's solution) relative to the person's blood plasma to prevent shrivelling or bursting.
	- **What would happen when animal cells are placed in a hypertonic solution?**#card
		- It would shrivel (water leaves the cell).
	- **What would happen when animal cells are placed in a hypotonic solution?**#card
		- It would swell and undergo lysis (burst) (as the water enters the cell)
	- **What happens when plant cells are placed in a hypertonic solution?**#card
		- They become plasmolysed. The vacuole within the cell shrivels but the plant cells themselves do not die due to their cell membrane moving away from the cell wall, allowing them to be rehydrated.
	- **What happens when plant cells are placed in a hypotonic solution?**#card
		- They become turgid, which is ideal for them. The water enters the cytoplasm and then the vacuole, causing the cell membrane to be pushed against the cell wall. The cell wall is rigid, thus there is a maximum amount the cell membrane can swell, and they will not undergo lysis, which makes them strong.
	- **What is the ideal condition for plants?**#card
		- Being turgid due to being in a hypotonic solution, as the water helps them have support.
	- **What happens when plant cells are placed in an isotonic solution?**#card
		- The vacuole within the cell is neither fully filled or shrivelled. There is no net movement of water in and out of the cell. In this case, the cell wall can be
	- **What adaptations do unicellular organisms have to survive hypertonic/hypotonic solutions?**#card
		- They have contractile vacuoles to expel water to prevent bursting in hypotonic solutions.
	- **What are contractile vacuoles?**#card
		- They get filled with water and expand but then expel the water, maintaining homeostasis.

- ### B2.2 Organelles and comparmentalisation
  collapsed:: true
	- What are organelles? #card
		- Compartmentalised, subcellular structures found within a cell which have specific functions. Cell walls, cytoplasms and cytoskeletons are **not** considered organelles.
	- What is cell fractionation and how did it help scientists learn about cells? #card
		- It is used to isolate different organelles to be studied by breaking apart cells. Cells must be submerged in a cold (to reduce enzyme activity to prevent damage to organelles), isotonic (to prevent shriveling or bursting of **organelles**) and buffered (to keep a constant pH) solution. There are two steps:
		- Homogenisation (breaking apart using a blender and filtration to remove large cell debris)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Ultracentrifguation (differential centrifugation where it is spun at different stages and at each stage the supernated (liquid) is removed to leave a pellet of a specific organelle, this is repeated)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Describe the process of ultracentrifugation in cell fraction. #card
		- The filtered solution is spun at a low speed by a centrifuge.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- The densest pellet is at the bottom.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- The supernated solution (at the top) is removed to leave the pellet of an organelle.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- The process is repeated with faster and faster speeds.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Describe the order of pellets formed by ultracentrifugation. #card
		- Nuclei -> chloroplast (in a plant cell) -> mitochondria -> lysosome -> endoplasmic reticulum -> ribosomes
	- What is the advantage of the separation of the nucleus and cytoplasm into separate compartments? #card
		- It allows process of transcription of mRNA to be separated from other metabolic processes within the cell. It also ensures DNA is protected from harmful reactions in the cytoplasm.
	- What is compartmentalisation? #card
		- Process of creating separation within cells. Organelles are an example of this which allow for greater efficiency and provide a protective environment for specialised activities which are not compatible with other metabolic processes.
	- What are lysosomes? #card
		- Organelles that contain enzymes to digest macromolecules and digest cell components. For example, if the cell is damaged, the enzymes are released which leads to its digestion.
- ### B2.3 Cell specialisation
	- What is SAV (surface area to volume ratio)? #card
		- Mathematical ratio between surface area to volume that can help describe the efficiency of the cell.
	- What effect does compartmentalisation have on SAV? #card
		- It increases surface area to volume ratio which increases efficiency of cell processes and increases absorption etc.
	- Though smaller cells have greater SAV, why are cells that are too small not necessarily optimal? #card
		- If the volume is too low, it cannot hold enough organelles to carry out many cell functions, which actually reduces efficiency. So both surface area and volume are important.
	- What is a stem cell? #card
		- Undifferentiated cells which have an unlimited capacity to divide and can differentiate into specalised cells. They change through differential gene expression.
	- What type of stem cells are adult stem cells? #card
		- Multipotent
	- What is a totipotent stem cell? #card
		- Stem cells that can differentiate into all types of cells or develop into an embryo.
	- What is a unipotent stem cell? #card
	- What is a pluripotent? #card
		- Cells that can differentiate into all types of cells, except
	- What are morphogens? #card
		- Group of gene regulating chemicals which determine the specialised cell that develops according to their concentration.
	- What are stem cell niches? #card
		- Locations in the body where stem cells can be maintained or promoted to proliferate and differentiate. For example, bone marrow is a niche for hematopoietic stem cells, hair follicles contain many types of stem cells, such as epithelial, mesenchymal (hair) cells that can self-renew, differentiate, regulate hair growth and maintain skin homeostasis.
	- How do stem cells divide? #card
		- They divide asymmetrically through mitosis, where one becomes another stem cell after division, but the other becomes a differentiated cell. This prolongs the life of the stem cell (as it makes a copy of itself).
- ### D2.1 Cell and Nuclear Division
	- What is cell division? #card
		- Division of a parent cell to produce two daughter cells and occurs in all living organisms.
	- Why does cell division occur? #card
		- To grow and to replace dead or damaged cells.
	- What is cytokinesis? #card
		- The splitting of the cytoplasm of a parent cell to form two daughter cells and occurs after nuclear division.
	- How does cytokinesis occur in animal cells? #card
		- It occurs through a contractile ring made with actin and myosin filaments that pull and create a cleavage furrow, which deepens until the cell divides.
	- How does cytokinesis occur in plant cells? #card
		- The Golgi apparatus produces vesicles of carbohydrates that move to the equator of the cell. The vesicles fuse to form a cell plate. The membranes fuse to existing membrane on either side of the cell plate to form two separate cells. Cellulose is secreted to form the cell wal.
	- Describe unequal division of the cytoplasm. #card
		- When cytokinesis does not equally divide the cytoplasm between two daughter cells. An example is budding in yeast, where yeast cell quickly divides to conserve energy and to survive in unfavourable conditions.
	- What are cells without a nucleus called? #card
		- Anucleate
	- What is mitosis? #card
		- Nuclear division that produces two genetically identical daughter nuclei. It is required for growth and development and tissue repair.
	- Describe cell cycle. #card
		- Interphase (90% of the time): DNA is uncondensed into chromatin, is replicated and the cell grows in size.
		- Mitosis (10% of the time): Cell division.
	- Describe the process of mitosis. #card
		- Prophase: Chromosomes condense by histone proteins and become thicker. Spindle fibres are developed. Number - 2n.
		- Metaphase: Chromosomes line up in the equator of the cell. Spindle fibres attach to the centromeres through kinetochores. Spindle fibres contract. Number - 2n.
		- Anaphase: Spindle fibres separate sister chromatids to the sides of the cells as spindle fibres continue to contract.  Mictrotubule spindle fibres are held by centrioles. Number - 4n
		- Telophase: 2 new nuclei is formed surrounding the chromosomes, allowing 2 identical cells to form in cytokinesis. Chromatids turns into chromatid threads and becomes thin. Number - 4n.
		- Cytokinesis: Final cell separation through actin and myosin.
	- When our DNA is duplicated in interphase, why do we still have 46 chromosomes? #card
		- We have 46 chromatids before replication which is called 46 chromosomes but this duplicates to 92 chromatids but 46 centromeres, which makes 46 chromosomes.
	- What is meiosis? #card
		- Nuclear division which produces four daughter cells each with half the chromosomes as the parent cell. It is a form of reduction division.
	- How does meiosis contribute to genetic variety? #card
		- Crossing over
	- Describe the process of meoisis. #card
		- PMAT 1 (meoisis I)
			- Prophase 1 - chromosomes condense and line up with their homologous pairs and cross over, forming recombinant chromosomes
			- Metaphase 1 - chromosomes line up in the middle where independent assortment occurs where chromosomes are randomly separated (with $2^{23}$ combinations)
		- PMAT 2 (meosis II)
	- How can genetic variation happen? #card
		- Crossing over, independent assortment
	- What is nondisjunction? #card
		- When chromosomes in anaphase are not split properly, leading to either too little or two many chromosomes. This can lead to Down syndrome.
	- What is Down syndrome? #card
		- A disease caused mainly by trisomy 21 but also monosomy 21. It causes intellectual disabilities, heart defects and facial defects.
	- Describe DNA replication. #card
		- It produces two identical copies of a DNA molecule. It produces two identical copies of the chromosome DNA held by centromeres.
	- How do chromosomes condense? #card
		- DNA initially exists as chromatin. DNA coils around histone proteins to form nucleosomes. The nucleosomes then coil around each other to form two sister chromatids attached at the centrosome to create a chromosome.
	- What is the haploid number in humans?#card
		- 23
	- What is the diploid number in humans? #card
